       "      <td>750 ml bottle, 2016 vintage, bottle #304 of 360. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit (raisin, plum), chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of licorice. For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but with some coffee flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, worth picking up if you want a nice straight forward imperial stout. Here's hoping Four String brings this back in the future! $9.99 a bottle.</td>\n",

       "33427    Dansting         2007-12-15     Bottle. Poured a cloudy purplish-brown color with a medium almond head. Strong lacing. Aroma is really sweet with a caramel and fruit scent to it, with a bit of hops. Nice mouthfeel. Flavor is disappointing. Too sweet for my liking. Very fruity and not hoppy enough for my liking. Very sugary.

Khaki colored head that leaves a lot of lace. S: Smells like caramel apples. Nice. T: Tart apples awash in caramel, spicey molassas, bartlett pears, and chocolate covered cherries.

       "         Gehrig           2008-09-07     Dense, cloudy brown with burnt orange highlights. A nice finger of tan head doesn't last long or leave much lacing, little surprise given the style and high ABV (9%). Still, it's a nice presentation. Good aromas, lots of berry, some molasses, more malty than hopped--definitely smells on the sweet end. I like the taste--again more sweet than sour or bitter, nicely malted, good berry flavor, nice if subtle molasses. But this could be bolder and, unlike the nose, maltier in the flavor. Certanly not all barleywines are the same, with some weighing more with malt or hops. Some, such as the masterpiece that is Great Divide's Old Ruffian, strike a great balance between the two. Cereal Killer could use more of both, and personally I like more hops in taste and texture than appear here. Thus, the mouthfeel isn't off-putting, but isn't attractive either. It's thin for barleywine. On the other hand, it's also smooth and accessible. This is good barleywine, shortcomings though there are. This could do with a good cellaring.    4.00  4.00   4.00   3.50  4.00     3.95     1\n",

       "3        Jason            2002-04-17     Presentation: 16oz brown with no freshness date. Appearance: Cloudy rustic orange in colour due to the poor sedimentation of the yeast (be careful when decanting). A more than decent lace crawls up the sides of the glass. Smell: Sweet and citriusy from the hop with an underlying grain aroma. Taste: Slightly aggressive hop bitterness with a citrus and leafy flavour. A little chewy in this medium bodied brew with a very smooth mouth feel. Quite fruity from the hops and alcoholic esters. The after taste is lingering fruit, hops and a nutty flavour from the yeast. Notes: A relatively decent IPA though perhaps a better fluctuating yeast would help with the sedimentation ... other than that, it is a very enjoyable brew and very much an American IPA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3.50  4.00   4.00   4.50  4.00     4.02     1\n",

Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: \"Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose\" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure. Overall, this one stands somewhere near the top of the New England IPA's.</td>\n",

Taste: Notes of molasses, lots of brandy, and a slight hint of prune juice. Not as much spiciness as I would expect from the rye. Very sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium to light body. A decent dry finish. Very smooth though. Overall: This is pretty OK, and definitely worth trying, but not mind blowing. Tastes like a middle-of-the road Barley Wine to me, and not much to differentiate it as a Rye Wine.

Aromas of big raisin, prune, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toast, rye, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, caramel, apple, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, rye, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark/light fruits, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, rye, nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/toasted malt and fruity ester flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barleywine style. All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.</td>\n",

       "3          0% 16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: \"Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose\" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure.

       "37         Poured a bit lively and had to wait for it to settle very nice lacing. Slightly hazy golden straw. Floral notes maybe a hint of citrus. Quite smooth on the palate a touch bitter and definitely a pungent finish as advertised. Somewhat of a dry finish and something about the lingering taste is off. The mouth coating is a touch creamy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "43         Quite balanced and distinct IPA of a West Coast style IPA from this small prairie city brewery. Packs a punch at 7abv but the bite is layered by pine and citrus aroma and taste, but a nice malt finish and stands up to many west coast IPAs.

       "358792     500 ml bottle into a pint glass. A-The brew had an amber color with honey and apricot tones. Mine poured with virtually no head and very little visible carbonation. S-The smell was dominated by a phenolic, chemical note. It was quite sweet and a little off-putting. I didn't get any fruit, floral, hop, or yeast notes. T-Pretty bland. There was a touch of malt and a hint of apple and floral flavor, but that off-putting chemical quality persists. M-slightly oily. No carbonation meant that it drank easily, but without much in the way of taste, I took my time finishing my one glass. O-This came recommended by two guys at the liquor store in Vancouver and I was intrigued by the idea of drinking a beer brewed in Greenland, so perhaps I had unreasonably high hopes, but I found it disappointing all around. Perhaps I got a bad/old bottle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "358818     On tap at Harrah's Casino in Philadelphia. What am I doing drinking this at a casino? Why is it in a pint glass? Appearance: Deep dark ruby red, with minimal head and minimal lacing. Smell: A slight whiff of rye, mostly dominated by brandy and sweet cherry. Taste: Notes of molasses, lots of brandy, and a slight hint of prune juice. Not as much spiciness as I would expect from the rye. Very sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium to light body. A decent dry finish. Very smooth though. Overall: This is pretty OK, and definitely worth trying, but not mind blowing. Tastes like a middle-of-the road Barley Wine to me, and not much to differentiate it as a Rye Wine. Overall, not bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "358836     12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/5/2014. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toast, rye, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, caramel, apple, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, rye, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark/light fruits, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, rye, nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/toasted malt and fruity ester flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barleywine style. All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.     \n",
       "358846     Leinenkugel’s Big Eddy Ryewine Ale has a thin-to-medium beige head, a semi-clear, red-brown (amber) appearance, some visible bubble streams, no sediment, and minimal lacing left behind. The aroma is of rich bread, cream sherry, sweetness, caramel, and nougat. Flavor is of those elements, a little metal (sadly), some alcohol, and toffee. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick, and Leinenkugel’s Big Eddy Ryewine finishes semi-dry, surprisingly refreshing, and easily drinkable. Very little alcohol detected in this booze bomb. Overall, this is most excellent.

Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: \"Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose\" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure. Overall, this one stands somewhere near the top of the New England IPA's.</td>\n",

       "      <td>500 ml bottle into a pint glass. A-The brew had an amber color with honey and apricot tones. Mine poured with virtually no head and very little visible carbonation. S-The smell was dominated by a phenolic, chemical note. It was quite sweet and a little off-putting. I didn't get any fruit, floral, hop, or yeast notes. T-Pretty bland. There was a touch of malt and a hint of apple and floral flavor, but that off-putting chemical quality persists. M-slightly oily. No carbonation meant that it drank easily, but without much in the way of taste, I took my time finishing my one glass. O-This came recommended by two guys at the liquor store in Vancouver and I was intrigued by the idea of drinking a beer brewed in Greenland, so perhaps I had unreasonably high hopes, but I found it disappointing all around. Perhaps I got a bad/old bottle.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On tap at Harrah's Casino in Philadelphia. What am I doing drinking this at a casino? Why is it in a pint glass? Appearance: Deep dark ruby red, with minimal head and minimal lacing. Smell: A slight whiff of rye, mostly dominated by brandy and sweet cherry. Taste: Notes of molasses, lots of brandy, and a slight hint of prune juice. Not as much spiciness as I would expect from the rye. Very sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium to light body. A decent dry finish. Very smooth though. Overall: This is pretty OK, and definitely worth trying, but not mind blowing. Tastes like a middle-of-the road Barley Wine to me, and not much to differentiate it as a Rye Wine. Overall, not bad.</td>\n",

Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toast, rye, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, caramel, apple, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, rye, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark/light fruits, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, rye, nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/toasted malt and fruity ester flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barleywine style. All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.</td>\n",

       "3          0% 16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: \"Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose\" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure. Overall, this one stands somewhere near the top of the New England IPA's.                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

The mouth coating is a touch creamy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "43         Quite balanced and distinct IPA of a West Coast style IPA from this small prairie city brewery. Packs a punch at 7abv but the bite is layered by pine and citrus aroma and taste, but a nice malt finish and stands up to many west coast IPAs.

       "358792     500 ml bottle into a pint glass. A-The brew had an amber color with honey and apricot tones. Mine poured with virtually no head and very little visible carbonation. S-The smell was dominated by a phenolic, chemical note. It was quite sweet and a little off-putting. I didn't get any fruit, floral, hop, or yeast notes. T-Pretty bland. There was a touch of malt and a hint of apple and floral flavor, but that off-putting chemical quality persists. M-slightly oily. No carbonation meant that it drank easily, but without much in the way of taste, I took my time finishing my one glass. O-This came recommended by two guys at the liquor store in Vancouver and I was intrigued by the idea of drinking a beer brewed in Greenland, so perhaps I had unreasonably high hopes, but I found it disappointing all around. Perhaps I got a bad/old bottle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "358818     On tap at Harrah's Casino in Philadelphia. What am I doing drinking this at a casino? Why is it in a pint glass? Appearance: Deep dark ruby red, with minimal head and minimal lacing. Smell: A slight whiff of rye, mostly dominated by brandy and sweet cherry. Taste: Notes of molasses, lots of brandy, and a slight hint of prune juice. Not as much spiciness as I would expect from the rye. Very sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium to light body. A decent dry finish. Very smooth though. Overall: This is pretty OK, and definitely worth trying, but not mind blowing. Tastes like a middle-of-the road Barley Wine to me, and not much to differentiate it as a Rye Wine. Overall, not bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toast, rye, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, caramel, apple, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, rye, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark/light fruits, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, rye, nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/toasted malt and fruity ester flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barleywine style. All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.     \n",
       "358846     Leinenkugel’s Big Eddy Ryewine Ale has a thin-to-medium beige head, a semi-clear, red-brown (amber) appearance, some visible bubble streams, no sediment, and minimal lacing left behind. The aroma is of rich bread, cream sherry, sweetness, caramel, and nougat. Flavor is of those elements, a little metal (sadly), some alcohol, and toffee. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick, and Leinenkugel’s Big Eddy Ryewine finishes semi-dry, surprisingly refreshing, and easily drinkable. Very little alcohol detected in this booze bomb. Overall, this is most excellent.

       "      <td>From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.</td>\n",

Pours a hazy dark orange color with a one finger off-white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.</td>\n",

Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops.

       "1         From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.     \n",
       "2         This beer is a decent overall value being that you get what you pay for. It has a pretty, dark red copper hue in the stien. Nice on the palet with a thick creamy feel. Fairly low on carbination. Intense aromas of alcohol and ripe fruit without being sweet and sticky. Nice carmely flavor, somewhat malty and savory. This beer is a nice convorsational sipper that I would gladly purchase again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "21717     Huge thanks to sideshowe for sharing this rare gem! Pours a hazy dark orange color with a one finger off-white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "21720     12 oz bottle with no date, says 8% ABV (not 7.85%). Wow! Pours amber-tinted golden, moderate white head with sticky lacing. Incredibly balanced aromas of nectarine and peach, tangerine and a little orange and ripe grapefruit, warm tropicals, just a tad lemon, some pine, a tad dank, mostly sweet. Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops. All the components line up humbly in their place, waiting for you to explore them, never overstepping, and creating a symphony on the palate. Feel is medium bodied, creamy enough. Finish is a pleasant variety of bitter, a combination of dryness with citrus peel freshness. I loved this beer to the point that it may be better than Pliny. So happy to have found it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "21721     On tap at Varga Bar in Philly. Served on 6/28/12 into a snifter. Pour: Mostly clear deep amber. Little bit of carbonation. Two finger off-white head. Smell: Great caramel malts and pine. Sweet. Some grapefruit. Taste: Pine followed by bitterness and caramel sweetness. Ends with honey. Mouthfeel: Pretty light and drinkable, not as bitter as I expected based on the Union Jack. Overall: Very tasty, and recommended. Not Firestone Walker's best (especially for price) by a long shot, but still hold's to their standard of excellence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

A - Pours a slightly hazy mahogany tinted amber with a short half finger of foam the falls quickly and leaves behind a thick, foamy collar around the edge of the glass. Traces of lacing linger on the glass. S - Interesting aroma - a bit different. First whiff, I get some nice fresh grassy hops - a pleasant opening surprise that I wasn't expecting. Behind that I get some potent bourbon and a strong helping of sweet, caramelly, toffee malt. Smells very well balanced - approaching, but not quite barley wine like in impression. T - I continue to get grassy hops in the flavor too which is very welcome and well placed here. Sweet caramel malt, traces of earthy malt, lightly fruity/estery. Sweet bourbon notes too - integrated nicely without an overbearing intensity. First and foremost this is still a red ale - the barrel adds bourbon nuances with a touch of booziness, but well controlled. M - Quite full bodied, thick and rather syrupy in feel. Lower level carbonation fits in well adding only a low tingle on the tongue. More tingle from the bourbon boozy warmth, but again at a low level. Just the way I like it - enough to be well noticed, but not so much as to overpower the base beer. O - Had no idea what to expect going into this - no experience with the beer or the brewery itself...not to mention bourbon barrel imperial reds aren't exactly mainstream either. I find it rather enjoyable. Stops short of being an out and out barley wine in character. Feels lighter although the fullness of the body cannot be denied. I like the firm grassy hop character in the nose and the taste - really brightens things up in both areas. Balance is quite good, drinkability is far better than I expected. I would definitely have this one again.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Got this at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam. From a bottle into a pint glass. APPEARANCE: Pours a nice 1+ finger thick tan head that fades fast into a very thin film, though some foam remains around the edges. Color is pitch black and opaque. Film disappears totally and leaves no lacing. Color is nice, but it looks pretty average by the midway point. SMELL: A powerful nose of roasted and smoky barley malt. A strong scent of pure bitter chocolate, with a bit of coffee in the background as well, but the roasted malt is still in the forefront. Very nice and makes a statement. TASTE: Roasted barley malt up front with a nice smoky component and a touch of licorice as well. The aftertaste is very nice; starts with bitter pure chocolate, a bit of espresso, and then finishes with a slight bit of spicy alcohol at the end. A strong, pleasant taste that tells a story. Nice. PALATE: Silky creamy smooth on the palate, medium-full body with medium carbonation. Goes down slightly rough with a bit of an alcohol bite at the end. Very sticky and mouth coating on the palate. OVERALL: Though the look was average, the rest of the experience was top notch. Smelt and tasted very impressive. This was a great treat and I'll definitely pick up another bottle in the future, even though it was a whopping 5 euro in Amsterdam. Recommended.</td>\n",

Neuman Haystack yellow with fuzzy lemon peel highlights and a 7UP-like crown that fizzed into the atmosphere inside of five seconds. No head and no lace results in an appearance that is nothing like beer. Wait, this is shandy. It still doesn't look good. The aroma is a tough call because it's pleasantly lemony and I'm a lemonophile. Trouble is, it smells nothing like beer. Wait, this is shandy. It should still smell like beer, even if only a little. Turbo Shandy is the best hard lemonade that I've ever had. Granted, this makes about three total. It has the right amount of sweetness, the right amount of lemon flavor, the right amount of pale maltiness, and the right ABV to deliver a solid flavor punch without crossing the line into 'shot of grain alcohol' nastiness. On second thought, the smell score deserves to be above average, especially given the style. There really isn't much to say regarding the flavor profile. It's an incredibly simple combination of pale malts and lemon, with the proportions right where they should be. The mouthfeel is light-medium and isn't as fizzy as expected. The bubbles are actually well done. The sugars give it a stickiness that lightly coats the mouth and tongue after each sip. Like lemonade, just not to the same extent. Turbo Shandy is a pretty good summertime (non-beer) beverage, as long as you know what you're getting into. Again, this is what all hard lemonades should taste like. If this offering is the replacement for Smashin' Berry Ale and Smashin' Berry Dark, then it's a smashing success.</td>\n",

Smell: Redolent spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and citrus peelings are the standouts and pretty heavy on the aromatics) atop some dusky, dark malts. Taste: Roasty, toasty malts with some smokey notes. Medium sweetness. Clumsy, excessive spicing. It's a lumbering, relentless charge of ground earthy nutmeg, chiefly, with some pops orange and cinnamon. Lingering cinnamon hint of Big Red gum and alcohol. Mercy, it's a mess! Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-light carbonation. Overall: A prime example of how to seriously overspice a beer and forego the adage 'less is more'. I couldn't even come close to finishing it. \"Liquid version of a classic breakfast.\" Whaaat?

       "6695      Ample haze runs through a mostly golden beer. Interesting aroma here, mango-kiwi like fruit. Clean sour, brett notes not noticeable. Drinks like an upland kiwi lambic but without the massive sourness or harsh acidity. Lacto sour. Probably my favorite Jackie O's beer, very well done, cool unique spin on a relatively unknown or underutilized fruit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "15722     22oz red waxed bottle poured into a CBS oversized snifter. A - Pours a slightly hazy mahogany tinted amber with a short half finger of foam the falls quickly and leaves behind a thick, foamy collar around the edge of the glass. Traces of lacing linger on the glass. S - Interesting aroma - a bit different. First whiff, I get some nice fresh grassy hops - a pleasant opening surprise that I wasn't expecting. Behind that I get some potent bourbon and a strong helping of sweet, caramelly, toffee malt. Smells very well balanced - approaching, but not quite barley wine like in impression. T - I continue to get grassy hops in the flavor too which is very welcome and well placed here. Sweet caramel malt, traces of earthy malt, lightly fruity/estery. Sweet bourbon notes too - integrated nicely without an overbearing intensity. First and foremost this is still a red ale - the barrel adds bourbon nuances with a touch of booziness, but well controlled. M - Quite full bodied, thick and rather syrupy in feel. Lower level carbonation fits in well adding only a low tingle on the tongue. More tingle from the bourbon boozy warmth, but again at a low level. Just the way I like it - enough to be well noticed, but not so much as to overpower the base beer. O - Had no idea what to expect going into this - no experience with the beer or the brewery itself...not to mention bourbon barrel imperial reds aren't exactly mainstream either. I find it rather enjoyable. Stops short of being an out and out barley wine in character. Feels lighter although the fullness of the body cannot be denied. I like the firm grassy hop character in the nose and the taste - really brightens things up in both areas. Balance is quite good, drinkability is far better than I expected. I would definitely have this one again.     \n",
       "19710     Pours black with a brown mocha head. A rich creamy aroma of lactose, white chocolate and espresso. An awesome espresso and lactose flavor rounded out with a little white chocolate. Only thing that holds it back is that it isn't as full as it could be, just a touch watered down it seemed. A nice creamy, medium to full body on this. Overall, I loved this beer. As a big milk stout fan, as a big coffee stout fan, the blend of these two worked very well for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2211      Pours mahogany with a pinky of tan head. Good head retention & slightly above average lacing S: Roastyness, slight peppery notes T: Roasty, peppery, with herbal notes, some pineyness & slight smokeyness up front. Roastyness , spicy rye, & a little brown bread & more pineyness. Finishes piney, peppery, & spicy, plus roastyness MF: Medium bodied, firm carbonation Works better as a black IPAor hell even a porter than a Kolsch, drinkable enough. Stone is starting to get a little out there, but I like they are still trying to push some boundries. Glad I got to try this, but not really buying the concept of a Black Rye Kolsch...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "2729      Got this at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam. From a bottle into a pint glass. APPEARANCE: Pours a nice 1+ finger thick tan head that fades fast into a very thin film, though some foam remains around the edges. Color is pitch black and opaque. Film disappears totally and leaves no lacing. Color is nice, but it looks pretty average by the midway point. SMELL: A powerful nose of roasted and smoky barley malt. A strong scent of pure bitter chocolate, with a bit of coffee in the background as well, but the roasted malt is still in the forefront. Very nice and makes a statement. TASTE: Roasted barley malt up front with a nice smoky component and a touch of licorice as well. The aftertaste is very nice; starts with bitter pure chocolate, a bit of espresso, and then finishes with a slight bit of spicy alcohol at the end. A strong, pleasant taste that tells a story. Nice. PALATE: Silky creamy smooth on the palate, medium-full body with medium carbonation. Goes down slightly rough with a bit of an alcohol bite at the end. Very sticky and mouth coating on the palate. OVERALL: Though the look was average, the rest of the experience was top notch. Smelt and tasted very impressive. This was a great treat and I'll definitely pick up another bottle in the future, even though it was a whopping 5 euro in Amsterdam.

       "3595      \"We are living in a world today where lemonade is made from artificial flavors and furniture polish is made from real lemons.\" --Alfred E. Neuman Haystack yellow with fuzzy lemon peel highlights and a 7UP-like crown that fizzed into the atmosphere inside of five seconds. No head and no lace results in an appearance that is nothing like beer. Wait, this is shandy. It still doesn't look good. The aroma is a tough call because it's pleasantly lemony and I'm a lemonophile. Trouble is, it smells nothing like beer. Wait, this is shandy. It should still smell like beer, even if only a little. Turbo Shandy is the best hard lemonade that I've ever had. Granted, this makes about three total. It has the right amount of sweetness, the right amount of lemon flavor, the right amount of pale maltiness, and the right ABV to deliver a solid flavor punch without crossing the line into 'shot of grain alcohol' nastiness. On second thought, the smell score deserves to be above average, especially given the style. There really isn't much to say regarding the flavor profile. It's an incredibly simple combination of pale malts and lemon, with the proportions right where they should be. The mouthfeel is light-medium and isn't as fizzy as expected. The bubbles are actually well done. The sugars give it a stickiness that lightly coats the mouth and tongue after each sip. Like lemonade, just not to the same extent. Turbo Shandy is a pretty good summertime (non-beer) beverage, as long as you know what you're getting into. Again, this is what all hard lemonades should taste like. If this offering is the replacement for Smashin' Berry Ale and Smashin' Berry Dark, then it's a smashing success.                                                                                                                      \n",
       "8441      12 ounce bottle - $3.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia. Appearance: Pours a dark amber-brown body with a diminishing, brief, off-white head. Smell: Redolent spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and citrus peelings are the standouts and pretty heavy on the aromatics) atop some dusky, dark malts. Taste: Roasty, toasty malts with some smokey notes. Medium sweetness. Clumsy, excessive spicing. It's a lumbering, relentless charge of ground earthy nutmeg, chiefly, with some pops orange and cinnamon. Lingering cinnamon hint of Big Red gum and alcohol. Mercy, it's a mess! Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-light carbonation. Overall: A prime example of how to seriously overspice a beer and forego the adage 'less is more'. I couldn't even come close to finishing it. \"Liquid version of a classic breakfast.\" Whaaat? I certainly hope this doesn't equate a \"classic breakfast\" in Pennsylvania, or anywhere else, for that matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.</td>\n",

Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.</td>\n",

       "1         From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.     \n",
       "2         This beer is a decent overall value being that you get what you pay for. It has a pretty, dark red copper hue in the stien. Nice on the palet with a thick creamy feel. Fairly low on carbination. Intense aromas of alcohol and ripe fruit without being sweet and sticky. Nice carmely flavor, somewhat malty and savory. This beer is a nice convorsational sipper that I would gladly purchase again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "21717     Huge thanks to sideshowe for sharing this rare gem! Pours a hazy dark orange color with a one finger off-white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "21720     12 oz bottle with no date, says 8% ABV (not 7.85%). Wow! Pours amber-tinted golden, moderate white head with sticky lacing. Incredibly balanced aromas of nectarine and peach, tangerine and a little orange and ripe grapefruit, warm tropicals, just a tad lemon, some pine, a tad dank, mostly sweet. Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops. All the components line up humbly in their place, waiting for you to explore them, never overstepping, and creating a symphony on the palate. Feel is medium bodied, creamy enough. Finish is a pleasant variety of bitter, a combination of dryness with citrus peel freshness. I loved this beer to the point that it may be better than Pliny. So happy to have found it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "21721     On tap at Varga Bar in Philly. Served on 6/28/12 into a snifter. Pour: Mostly clear deep amber. Little bit of carbonation. Two finger off-white head. Smell: Great caramel malts and pine. Sweet. Some grapefruit. Taste: Pine followed by bitterness and caramel sweetness. Ends with honey. Mouthfeel: Pretty light and drinkable, not as bitter as I expected based on the Union Jack. Overall: Very tasty, and recommended. Not Firestone Walker's best (especially for price) by a long shot, but still hold's to their standard of excellence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

We hope you just say, “Gimme a Lager.”                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.</td>\n",

Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.</td>\n",

       "1         From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.     \n",
       "2         This beer is a decent overall value being that you get what you pay for. It has a pretty, dark red copper hue in the stien. Nice on the palet with a thick creamy feel. Fairly low on carbination. Intense aromas of alcohol and ripe fruit without being sweet and sticky. Nice carmely flavor, somewhat malty and savory. This beer is a nice convorsational sipper that I would gladly purchase again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "21717     Huge thanks to sideshowe for sharing this rare gem! Pours a hazy dark orange color with a one finger off-white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "21720     12 oz bottle with no date, says 8% ABV (not 7.85%). Wow! Pours amber-tinted golden, moderate white head with sticky lacing. Incredibly balanced aromas of nectarine and peach, tangerine and a little orange and ripe grapefruit, warm tropicals, just a tad lemon, some pine, a tad dank, mostly sweet. Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops. All the components line up humbly in their place, waiting for you to explore them, never overstepping, and creating a symphony on the palate. Feel is medium bodied, creamy enough. Finish is a pleasant variety of bitter, a combination of dryness with citrus peel freshness. I loved this beer to the point that it may be better than Pliny. So happy to have found it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "21721     On tap at Varga Bar in Philly. Served on 6/28/12 into a snifter. Pour: Mostly clear deep amber. Little bit of carbonation. Two finger off-white head. Smell: Great caramel malts and pine. Sweet. Some grapefruit. Taste: Pine followed by bitterness and caramel sweetness. Ends with honey. Mouthfeel: Pretty light and drinkable, not as bitter as I expected based on the Union Jack. Overall: Very tasty, and recommended. Not Firestone Walker's best (especially for price) by a long shot, but still hold's to their standard of excellence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

We hope you just say, “Gimme a Lager.”                                                                                                                 \n",

The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience.

Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.</td>\n",

       "1         From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.     \n",
       "2         This beer is a decent overall value being that you get what you pay for. It has a pretty, dark red copper hue in the stien. Nice on the palet with a thick creamy feel. Fairly low on carbination. Intense aromas of alcohol and ripe fruit without being sweet and sticky. Nice carmely flavor, somewhat malty and savory. This beer is a nice convorsational sipper that I would gladly purchase again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "21717     Huge thanks to sideshowe for sharing this rare gem! Pours a hazy dark orange color with a one finger off-white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "21720     12 oz bottle with no date, says 8% ABV (not 7.85%). Wow! Pours amber-tinted golden, moderate white head with sticky lacing. Incredibly balanced aromas of nectarine and peach, tangerine and a little orange and ripe grapefruit, warm tropicals, just a tad lemon, some pine, a tad dank, mostly sweet. Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops. All the components line up humbly in their place, waiting for you to explore them, never overstepping, and creating a symphony on the palate. Feel is medium bodied, creamy enough. Finish is a pleasant variety of bitter, a combination of dryness with citrus peel freshness. I loved this beer to the point that it may be better than Pliny.

Smell: Great caramel malts and pine. Sweet. Some grapefruit. Taste: Pine followed by bitterness and caramel sweetness. Ends with honey. Mouthfeel: Pretty light and drinkable, not as bitter as I expected based on the Union Jack. Overall: Very tasty, and recommended. Not Firestone Walker's best (especially for price) by a long shot, but still hold's to their standard of excellence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "      <td>From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.</td>\n",

Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.</td>\n",

Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops. All the components line up humbly in their place, waiting for you to explore them, never overstepping, and creating a symphony on the palate. Feel is medium bodied, creamy enough.

       "1         From bomber to pint glass A: Slightly cloudy and murky, with sediment mixing upon pour (not intended though unavoidable). It has the look of ogranic Honey Crisp apple juice. The head is reasonable, 1.75 fingers. The lacing though is serious, and sticks around for the duration. S: Pineapple and tropical fruit. If I close my eyes I can feel the sun on the back of my neck and the sand under my toes. Hints of sweetened coconut milk intensify as it warms, which is utterly fantastic. T: Just what I was expecting - fresh, lavish hops that burst like a grenade in my mouth. I can't begin to tell you how inviting the citrus is. It actually seems as if I've got an umbrella in my drink while sitting on a motorboat in the islands. M: Slightly acidic, though fairly creamy and thick. The carbonation is ever so slightly sharp, but it's not off-putting. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. O: DuganA is not overly cloying like a lot of DIPA's I've had. The aftertaste sticks around, but you certainly won't smell like a brewery all night. DuganA is a fabulous beer. For as delicious as this bomber was, I must say that having it ON TAP is a genuine experience. It is one of the top ten beers I've had in the last year, and I can guarantee you'll thank me for recommending it. If you see the tap handle, look no further and enjoy.     \n",
       "2         This beer is a decent overall value being that you get what you pay for. It has a pretty, dark red copper hue in the stien. Nice on the palet with a thick creamy feel. Fairly low on carbination. Intense aromas of alcohol and ripe fruit without being sweet and sticky. Nice carmely flavor, somewhat malty and savory.

       "21717     Huge thanks to sideshowe for sharing this rare gem! Pours a hazy dark orange color with a one finger off-white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. Earthy, musty aroma with lots of barnyard/horsey character.  Hints of oak, funky bugs, lactic acid and cobweb followed by faint fruit and acetic vinegar.  I was expecting the nose to be bursting with cherry but it's pretty subtle.  Smells pretty good with some nice funk but kind of one dimensional. Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "21720     12 oz bottle with no date, says 8% ABV (not 7.85%). Wow! Pours amber-tinted golden, moderate white head with sticky lacing. Incredibly balanced aromas of nectarine and peach, tangerine and a little orange and ripe grapefruit, warm tropicals, just a tad lemon, some pine, a tad dank, mostly sweet. Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops. All the components line up humbly in their place, waiting for you to explore them, never overstepping, and creating a symphony on the palate. Feel is medium bodied, creamy enough. Finish is a pleasant variety of bitter, a combination of dryness with citrus peel freshness. I loved this beer to the point that it may be better than Pliny. So happy to have found it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "21721     On tap at Varga Bar in Philly. Served on 6/28/12 into a snifter. Pour: Mostly clear deep amber. Little bit of carbonation. Two finger off-white head. Smell: Great caramel malts and pine. Sweet. Some grapefruit. Taste: Pine followed by bitterness and caramel sweetness. Ends with honey. Mouthfeel: Pretty light and drinkable, not as bitter as I expected based on the Union Jack. Overall: Very tasty, and recommended.
