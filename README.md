## Introduction

The goal of my Beer Recommender system is to be able to predict what beers you'd enjoy, based on a user's input by choosing their favorite beer. At a very high level, we'll be using a recommendation system with NLP in order to come up with sound beer predictions.

## Business Problem

There is absolutely nothing worse than trying a new beer you end up HATING. You probably ordered that beer based off of some friend’s recommendation, an advertisement you saw on the subway or maybe it was the same style as a beer you’ve enjoyed previously. 

You sit there staring at a full glass hoping it would empty itself so you could go back to drinking something you know you’d enjoy. That’s where my model comes into play. Our predictions will allow you to stop making these miserable $8 mistakes and allow you to continue to try something new, with a strong guarantee you’ll enjoy it as well. 

## Data

To begin, I used various data from the BeerAdvocate website that included beer reviews provided by beer drinkers like us,  beer descriptions provided by the brewers and the styles of the beers. Examples of how this data looked like can be seen below.

Style: India Pale Ale, American Ale, German Witbier.

Reviews: “…hints of toasted bran, with a touch of malt sweetness balanced by a slightly heavy handed use of delicate noble hops to finish crisp and keep you coming…”

Descriptions: “...a combination of barley malts and rice. Its superior drinkability and refreshing flavor makes it the world’s favorite light beer.”
